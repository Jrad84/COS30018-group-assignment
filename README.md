# COS30018-group-assignment
Topic 3 - Automated Traffic Flow Prediction

# Training
Lag = data points to use eg 96 = 24 hours
Experiment with different input / output values, epochs

# To Do:
1) Interpret results 
2) Plot on graph (probably need a few different graphs)
3) Make predictions
4) Find and implement a different RNN model
5) Use GeoPandas or similar to input locations on map
6) Implement up to 5 search algs
7) Extension 3 - visualise routes
8) Write report
